This repo contains all the Python and HTML source code for a decision support system that predicts the nightly price of an online rental listing using anonymous data from an AirBnB-like platform. Notwithstanding the limitations in the size and representativeness of the training data, this project attempts to showcase the various steps in the end-to-end machine learning workflow, from Exploratory Data Analysis all the way to containerization and online deployment with a simple front-end interface.

As of Feb. 17, 2023, the application can be accessed for real-time prediction through the following link: https://bia-656-final-project-demo.herokuapp.com/. This may change in the future as I allocate Heroku bandwidth to other projects (at which point I will update this paragraph).
